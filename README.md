# SSR Hackdays Polis API Project

Code developped during the SSR Hackdays on March 1st-2nd. 

The extension school set up a team composed of learners and instructors to work on the newly released [Polis API](https://developer.srgssr.ch/apis/tpc-polis). We split up in two groups: a data group and a visualisation group.

## Data group

The data team wrote code in R to extract the results of the votations from the API. This project was an opportunity for the learners to learn the basics of APIs and explore important R libraries (httr, dplyr, tidyr, stringr...). The code was eventually wrapped into a web interface (built on [shiny](shiny.rstudio.com)).
